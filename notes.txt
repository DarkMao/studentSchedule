Data should be organized as an array of dictionaries(objects):
1 = name
2= lname
3= class
6 = period
7 = teacher
11 = grade
CV
{
    "firstname":<string>,
    "lastname":<string>,
    "grade":<int>,
    "schedule": {
                    "perA": {
                        subject: <String>,
                        teacher: <String>
                    },
                    "perB": {
                        subject: <String>,
                        teacher: <String>
                    },
                    ....
                }
}

For Joseph:
* Read a csv file in python
* Split by \n
* Split by comma (organized as 2D array - table)
* Removing array elements that are duplicate
    (if firstname, lastname, period, grade are identical)
* Create a new 2D array (table) that contains only necessary columns
        columns:    firstname, lastname, subject, grade, teacherlastname

placeholder: 

def create_dictionaries(test_data):
    split_data_by_line = []
    split_data_by_line = test_data.split("\n")
    print (split_data_by_line)
    test_dictionary = {'fname' : "", 'lname' : "", "class": "", "period" : "", "teacher": "", "grade" : ""}    
    for item in split_data_by_line:
        current_class = item.split(",")
        print (current_class)
        while "" in current_class:
            current_class.remove("")
        print (current_class)


FINAL GOAL for joseph: export dictionary as json file

order of things for jeffrey/faa:
* implement autocomplete
* allow user to type name into input element, add it to an array and clear the input box when enter is pressed
* create a table based on the array
* write a function that will take the current time and return the current period
